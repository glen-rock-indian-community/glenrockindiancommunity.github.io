We are a couple of expats, who immigrated from India to US, and ended up in Glen Rock, NJ.

Over the years we have kept the Indian culture alive by organizing festivals, cultural events, donation drives. This site serves as a timeline of our history in Glen Rock, documenting our memories around past events.

If you would like to post an article about an event being hosted or would like to document past events, check the github page for more details.
